# pop-quiz-time

This is my project to make a timed quiz application with questions regarding web development. 

## Description

This project requires extensive use of Javascript and no jQuery was used for this application. This application applied lots of DOM elements and HTML. 

You can contact me with any suggestions and improvements to the app.
